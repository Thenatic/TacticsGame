Tactics Game
v 0.1
####################

INTRO
 This little side project is a way for me to explore some of the techniques covered in my college classes and at my
 internship. It uses various design patterns from the Design Patterns book and the Game Programming Patterns book.

 The game itself has mechanics similar to Fire Emblem and Final Fantasy Tactics. It's a turn-based strategy RPG
 where units fight on a tiled grid.


TO-DO --> v 0.2
 * Add Terrain Impediments
 * Create the start menu
 * Set up the a finite state machine for the main game loop
 * Develop simple A.I. (find enemy/attack enemy)
 * Get save/load running


TO-DO --> Less Important
 * Multiple Victory and Defeat conditions
 * Improve, refine, and expand the skill parser

TO-DONE
 * Create a temporary interface to game objects in lieu of a GUI
 * Build an assortment of game elements (map class, roster class, skill class, etc.)
 * Use a data-driven model for game elements (JSON --> game objects)
 * Build a debuggable prototype of the Battle environment
 * Added Victory and Defeat conditions, so Battle can end
