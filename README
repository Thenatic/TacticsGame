Tactics Game

INTRO
 This little side project is a way for me to explore some of the techniques covered in my college classes.

 The game itself has mechanics similar to Fire Emblem and Final Fantasy Tactics. It's intended to be turn-based
 and character-driven. Everything else is still up in the air.


TO-DO
 * Get combat commands to work better (skill parser)
 * Implement spirit binding
 * Add Terrain Impediments
 * Create the start menu
 * Set up the a finite state machine for the main game loop
 * Develop simple A.I. (find enemy/attack enemy)
 * Get save/load running
